# bikeshare
Bikeshare project from my Udacity NanoDegree

I wrote this back in 2020 as my final project for the Udacity Data Science NanoDegree certificate.  It asks the user which of the three cities they'd like to get bikeshare data for along with which month and day of the week they are interested in.  It then displays a number of summary statistics on the data and the raw data itself.
